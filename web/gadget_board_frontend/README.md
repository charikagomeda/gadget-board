# Gadget-Board-Frontend

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.11-webpack.9-4.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. But the api links will not work with ´ng serve´, that will require running the full docker setup described in the root directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

See the directory root for more information.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
